# 🚀 C++ Key-Value Store (Redis-Inspired TCP Project)

This project is a **custom-built, minimal Redis-like key-value database system** implemented in modern C++. It includes a robust TCP server and a feature-rich client with custom protocol support, connection management, and local command history.

Designed to mimic the behavior of Redis using raw sockets and binary protocol encoding, it's a great learning resource for understanding:

- Sockets (TCP/IP)
- Custom binary protocol design
- Event-driven client-server communication
- Memory-safe and low-level systems programming in C++
- Efficient maintainance of the idle connections
- Data structures
- Manual memory management

## ✨ Features

### 🖥 Server
- Accepts multiple client connections
- Parses custom binary protocol
- Supports TTL-based expiration
- Automatically removes idle connections
- Handles ZSET (sorted set) operations

### 🧑‍💻 Client
- Command-line interface
- Automatic reconnection handling
- 10-second socket timeout with robust error handling
- Maintains local history of last 10 commands
- 'hist' command to display recent commands with timestamps
- Graceful exit on entering 'quit'

### ⚙️ Protocol
- Fully custom binary message framing
- Efficient type-tagged responses (nil, string, integer, float, array, error)
-Efficient responses given by the server in the binary format which is universally accepted that are 1 as success and 0 as failure

> ✅ All commands except 'HIST' are sent to the server using a binary protocol.

## 🔧 Build Instructions

### ✅ Requirements

- A Linux-based system or WSL
- 'g++' with C++17 or newer
- Basic familiarity with terminal usage

### 🔨 Compile

'''bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o server server.cpp
g++ -std=c++17 -o client client.cpp
## Usage 
- Clone the repository from the terminal of ubuntu based kernels using
 git clone https://github.com/karthik768990/tcp-keyvalue-store-ccp-redis-lite.git
-Then navigate to the folder using and also using the ubuntu or  linux based terminals is must for using or running this application as this includes some system unix system imports like the poll.h etc...

 cd tcp-keyvalue-store-ccp-redis-lite
-Compile both the server and the client codes using the commands mentions above and then run the cliend and the server separately in two separate terminals using
./server
./client
-Use the terminals input as the input of the commands from the client side and go with it and use the server.
